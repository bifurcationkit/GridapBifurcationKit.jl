# [Simple bifurcation branch point](@id simple-bp)

!!! unknown "References"
    The general method is exposed in Golubitsky, Martin, David G Schaeffer, and Ian Stewart. **Singularities and Groups in Bifurcation Theory**. New York: Springer-Verlag, 1985, VI.1.d page 295

A simple branch point ``(x_0,p_0)`` for the problem ``F(x,p)=0`` satisfies ``\dim \ker dF(x_0,p_0) = 1``. At such point, we can apply **Lyapunov-Schmidt** reduction to transform the initial problem in large dimensions to a **scalar** polynomial (``\delta p \equiv p-p_0``):

```math
a\delta p + z\left(b_1\delta p + \frac{b_2}{2}z + \frac{b_3}{6}z^2\right) = 0 \tag{E}
```

whose solutions give access to all solutions in a neighborhood of ``(x,p)``.

More precisely, if ``\ker dF(x_0,p_0) = \mathbb R\zeta``, one can show that ``x_0+z\zeta`` is close to a solution on a new branch, thus satisfying ``F(x_0+z\zeta,p_0+\delta p)\approx 0``.

In the above scalar equation,

- if ``a\neq 0``, this is a *Saddle-Node* bifurcation
- if ``a = 0, b_2\neq 0``, the bifurcation point is a *Transcritical* one where the bifurcated branch exists on each side of ``p``.
- if ``a = 0, b_2 = 0, b_3\neq 0``, the bifurcation point is a *Pitchfork* one where the bifurcated branch only exists on one side of ``p``. If it exists at smaller values than ``p``, this is a *subcritical Pitchfork* bifurcation. In the other case, this is a *supercritical Pitchfork* bifurcation.

## Normal form computation

The reduced equation (E) can be automatically computed as follows

```julia
get_normal_form(br::ContResult, ind_bif::Int ;
	verbose = false, ζs = nothing, lens = br.param_lens)
```

where `br` is a branch computed after a call to [`continuation`](@ref) with detection of
bifurcation points enabled and `ind_bif` is the index of the bifurcation point on the branch
`br`. The above call returns a point with information needed to compute the bifurcated
branch. For more information about the optional parameters, we refer to
[`get_normal_form`](https://bifurcationkit.github.io/BifurcationKitDocs.jl/stable/).

!!! info "Note"
    You should not need to call `get_normal_form` except if you need the full information about the branch point.
